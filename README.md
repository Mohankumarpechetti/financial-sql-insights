## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I explored 5 high-impact business scenarios, often used by banks and financial companies to understand customer behavior and risks.

### 🔍 Key Analyses Performed:

1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Categorized customers into Low, Medium, High segments based on their account balance

2. **Loan Behavior Insights**
   - Analyzed the distribution of customers and average balances based on loan status

3. **Campaign Performance by Month**
   - Found out which months yielded the most successful campaign responses

4. **Most Engaged Jobs**
   - Identified job categories with the highest engagement (duration) in marketing campaigns

5. **High-Risk Customer Detection**
   - Detected customers with both loans and low balance, potentially at financial risk
